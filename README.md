# Deep Learning Traffic Sign Classification
### Galen Ballew 2017


This project uses a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). The network architecture is based of the original LeNet architecture, but with L2 regularization and dropout introduced. The network achieves 97% accuracy on a test split of ~8,000 images (80:20 train:test split)
